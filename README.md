## SYST15123 OS - Linux: Assignment 4 pt. 2
Program: **Computer Programming @ Sheridan College** <br>
Note: The following assignment was completed during Semester 2 (2024) <br>
Language(s): Bash 

## The Details: 
Create a .txt file which contains information about your CD collection. Include at least 10 records. Each record in the file should have Artist, CDName, PurchaseDate and Cost using the ";" (semicolon character) as a delimiter. <br><br>
Create a Bash script file with a menu that lets you:
<ul>
  <li>View the contents of the music collection file - this option should display the entire collection</li>
  <li>View the cost of the entire collection - this option should calculate the total cost of the collection and display it, do not hard-code the cost of the collection...there must be code to calculate it</li>
  <li>Search for all CDs from a particular artist - this option allows to search the collection given the artist name, make the search case insensitive</li>
  <li>Search for all CDs purchased on a specific date - this option allows to search the collective given the date, make the search case insensitive</li>
  <li>An option to Exit - this option should confirm whether the user really wants to exit the script and if the confirmation is given then the script should be terminated...otherwise, the script should continue running</li>
</ul>

## Thoughts/Comments: 
This assignment stood out the most in my OS - Linux course because it required us to write a whole function using while, if/else statements. <br>
Reminder: the .txt file containing the artists was not uploaded.
